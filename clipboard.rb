#This commit: general: created third required error as before but this time did not 
#		uncomment the pertinent function call in app.rb because I created no rescue;
# 		listable.rb: fixed format_priority(priority) to respond to priority 
#  		(not @priority), added required error to function; udacilist: added case 
# 		for empty list; event.rb: added error for end date without start date.
#
# Ideas for improvements
# 
# Event
# Raise error an end date without start date, as it's actually a todo item.
#
# 
#
# Udacilist (a module)
# Raise error if call udacilist.rb with an improper option.
# Make default contents "empty"
#
# Listable (creates list)
# Change date to just the date
# 
# note.rb 
# Create a "note" type.
# 
# link.rb
