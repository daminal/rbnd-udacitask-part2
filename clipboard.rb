# This commit: finally got Chronic to work. Now, I may have to get it to stop spitting out 
# times when I don't need them. Can't find a requirement for this anywhere, though.

#Ideas for improvements
# 
#Event
# Raise error an end date without start date, as it's actually a todo item.
#
#Udacilist (a module)
# Raise error if call udacilist.rb with an improper option.
# Make default contents "empty"
#
#Listable (creates list)
# Check date format
